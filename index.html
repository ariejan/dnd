          Quinthya — Background
        </h3>

        <p>
          Quinthya remembers nothing of her early years. She was told, before entering the monastary, that there
          was some kind of <em>accident</em> that killed her parents and little brother – Vakian. While prepapring a
          complicated potion. During her years in the
          monastary she learned about the history of her land. Days on end she would sit and meditate in silence, forgoing
          food <em>and</em> drink finding inner peace - but also discovering that in the history books she studied also
          lies a grave warning.
        </p>

        <p>
          A great evil lurks in the East. Little is known about it, and connecting the dots has taken Quinthya many years.
          Quinthya's mentor, Grageon Glorygem, a Dwarf Monk, aka "Lord Grageon Glorygem the Unmatched", confirms her studies
          and notes that reports of this unknown evil have been circulating for the past 37 years - roughly the same
          number of years since Quinthya's parents died.
        </p>

        <p>
          When in trance, Quinthya sometimes sees flashes of this unknown, great evil. An army stands before an enourmous vessel,
          a flying ship, made of metal with four large tentacles on the front and six smaller legs aft.
          While the ships fires beams of light that destroys everything in its path, a small person charges to the front to challenge
          it. Quinthya has come to realize that this person, this person is her.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quinthya has left the monastary where she  lived 2 years ago on a quest to find and eliminate this evil. More
          rumours are coming out of the east of mayhem and destruction, fueling Quinthya's desire to complete her quest and
          ultimately make her contribution the world. She has traveled to Neverwinter to enroll in the Heroes Academy in
          the hopes of finding powerful allies, and maybe friends, to accompany her on her quest.
