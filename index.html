          Quinthya — Background
        </h3>

        <p>
          Quinthya remembers nothing of her early years. She was told, before entering the monastary, that there
          was some kind of <em>accident</em> that killed her parents and little borther – Vakian. While prepapring a 
          complicated potion During her years in the
          monastary she learned about the history of her land. Days on end she would sit and meditate in silence, finding 
          inner peace - but also discovering that in the history books she studied also lies a grave warning.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A great evil lurks in the East. Little is known about it, but according to Quinthya's mentor, it all began around 
          the same time as her parents died. Soon it became clear that, to fight this evil, more needed to be learned about
          it and Quinthya took it upon herself to seek out this unknown evil. And destroy it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When in trance, Quinthya sometimes sees flashes of her, fighting a great daemon, engulfed in bright green flame.
